I"ð<p>Most of the enterprise companies were migrating their infrastructure to cloud. They focused mainly on security in cloud, and DevOps teams were implementing CI/CD pipeline and integrating their tools with security tooling. In our article i would like to discuss to detect weak SSH credentials in DevOps environments using Metasploit tool.</p>

<h4 id="devops-environment---security-checks-ssh-keys">DevOps Environment - Security Checks (SSH Keys):</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Most of the DevOps environment VMs/Machines are using default credentials (vagrant/vagrant , root/vagrant)</li>
  <li>Scanning the default SSH keys using metasploit - ssh_login_pubkey module.</li>
  <li>Identify the weak SSH keys versions after the scan.</li>
  <li>Login with Private key.</li>
  <li>Get the vagrant/root shell.</li>
</ol>
