I"½<p>Most of the times, When i was handling some IR investigations, I found some missing part and important artifacts in Linux machines. As a DFIR investigator, we do timeline analysis and look at malicious command execution history in linux machines.</p>

<p>But most of the lazy linux administrators were not enabling the history logging with date in linux machines. We donâ€™t see those command logging capabilities in most of the organisations, It will be very challenging for DFIR investigators while handling the incidents.</p>

<p>I would like to share some quick tip for all lazy linux administrators.</p>
