Hi Team,

It's been around 7 months, I didn't get any response from Ecommerce team. Hope everything is sorted out now.

Could you please respond to my query below? (Following up my old email)

I planned my honeymoon to the Maldives and I booked my tickets from Banglore to Male  (Two-way Journey). Due to COVID-19 emergency situation, Air India cancelled those flights.
I need to get my refund on my bookings (The whole ticket cost is around 30k+. that's why I'm worrying a lot.)  Could you please help me with this?
